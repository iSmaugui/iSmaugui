ðŸ’­ Hello, my name is Paulo and I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree in *Mechanical Engineering*. I currently work on a local metallurgy industry in the process and engineering department. 
Aside from that, I've always been curious about computers and how they work. During my second year of college, I was introduced to the C programming language and felt in love with it.
I'm here to learn more about C and C++, game development, and embedded systems. I'm not an expert in these areas, but I will do my best to contribute however I can.

ðŸŒ™ My username, "iSmaugui," is inspired by the character Smaug from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. 

Cheers xd
